This project is a Flask-based web application designed for real-time traffic monitoring, prediction, and optimization. It leverages machine learning models and clustering techniques to classify traffic conditions and suggest optimal tower locations for underserved areas.

## Features üåü

- **Real-Time Traffic Monitoring**: Classifies traffic based on upload/download speeds and latency.
- **Prediction of Traffic Class**: Uses a machine learning model to categorize traffic into High-Speed, Normal, or Low-Speed.
- **Resource Allocation**: Dynamically adjusts bandwidth for users based on traffic classification.
- **Optimal Tower Placement**: Analyzes underserved areas and suggests optimal cell tower locations using clustering techniques.
- **Interactive Map**: Visualizes underserved areas and potential tower locations with GeoJSON data.
